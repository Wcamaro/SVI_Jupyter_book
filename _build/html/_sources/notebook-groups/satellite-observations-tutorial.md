# Satellite Observations Tutorial

Satellite observations play a crucial role in monitoring various aspects of the Earth's atmosphere, surface, and cryosphere. This tutorial series explores the utilization of satellite data for comprehensive meteorological analyses and environmental monitoring.

## [Earth Radiation Budget](./erb.md)

The Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) refers to the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing thermal radiation at the top of the Earth's atmosphere. Understanding the ERB is vital for assessing the planet's energy balance and its implications for climate dynamics. This subsection focuses on analyzing components of the Earth's radiation budget using satellite observations.

## [Surface Radiation Budget](./srb.md)

The Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) encompasses the exchange of radiation between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. This subsection delves into utilizing satellite data to analyze surface radiation fluxes, including incoming solar radiation, outgoing longwave radiation, and reflected shortwave radiation. Understanding surface radiation budgets aids in assessing regional energy budgets and climate variability.

## [Atmospheric Humidity and Cloud](./atmos-humidity-cloud.md)

Atmospheric humidity and cloud cover play crucial roles in regulating the Earth's energy balance and hydrological cycle. This subsection explores satellite-based measurements of atmospheric humidity, including total column water vapor and tropospheric humidity estimates derived from radio occultation data. Additionally, it examines satellite-derived cloud cover climatologies, providing insights into cloud fraction distributions and their impact on weather and climate processes.

## [Atmospheric Composition](./atmos-composition.md)

Satellite observations facilitate the monitoring of atmospheric composition, including greenhouse gases, aerosols, and ozone levels. This subsection discusses utilizing satellite data to analyze greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosol optical properties, and total ozone columns. Understanding atmospheric composition dynamics is essential for assessing air quality, understanding climate forcings, and studying atmospheric chemistry.

## [Surface Water](./surface-water.md)

Satellite observations offer valuable insights into surface water dynamics, including soil moisture, lake levels, and river discharge. This subsection explores utilizing satellite data to analyze soil moisture anomalies, monitor lake water levels over time, and assess surface water temperature variations. Understanding surface water dynamics aids in water resource management, flood forecasting, and ecosystem monitoring.

## Ice Sheets

Satellite observations provide invaluable information on the dynamics of polar ice sheets, including surface elevation changes, ice velocity, and mass balance. This subsection focuses on utilizing satellite data to study ice sheet surface elevation variations, ice velocity patterns, and mass balance trends. Understanding ice sheet dynamics is crucial for assessing sea level rise, glacier contributions to the cryosphere, and climate feedback mechanisms.
