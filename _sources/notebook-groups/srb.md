# Surface Radiation Budget

The surface radiation budget is a crucial component of Earth's energy balance, representing the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation at the Earth's surface. This subsection delves into the analysis of surface radiation budget climatologies and anomalies, providing insights into variations in solar and terrestrial radiation fluxes over time and space.

## [Surface Radiation Budget Climatologies and Anomalies](../notebooks/srb-climatology-and-anomaly/srb-climatology-and-anomaly.ipynb)

This notebook provides you with an introduction on EUMETSAT's CM SAF **CLARA-A3** dataset available at the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) (CDS). The dataset contains data for Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) _Surface Radiation Budget_, as well as _Cloud Properties and Earth Radiaiton Budget_, while this notebook focuses on **Surface Radiation Budget** as part of the ECV _Surface Radiation Budget_ available here: [Surface Radiation Budget from 1982 to present derived from satellite observations](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-surface-radiation-budget?tab=overview).

The notebook covers the full process from scratch and starts with a short introdution to the dataset and how to access the data from the Climate Data Store of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). This is followed by a step-by-step guide on how to process and visualize the data. Once you feel comfortable with the python code, you are invited to adjust or extend the code according to your interests. After a short introduction how to use a Jupyter notebook the analysis starts.<br>
Two figures below are results of Use Case 1 and 2, and the result of a successful run of the code.
