# Atmospheric Humidity and Cloud Notebooks

## [Total Column Water Vapour](../notebooks/total-column-water-vapour-combi/total-column-water-vapour-combi.ipynb)

This notebook-tutorial provides an introduction to the use of the
combined global near-infrared (NIR) and microwave imager (MWI) total column water vapour (TCWV) data record ([COMBI](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-total-column-water-vapour-land-ocean?tab=overview))
for climate studies.

## [Tropospheric Humidity Estimates from Satellite-based Radio Occultation Measurements](../notebooks/tropospheric-humidity-from-radio-occultation/tropospheric-humidity-from-radio-occultation.ipynb)

In this tutorial we will work with monthly-mean tropospheric humidity data from the Climate Data Store (CDS), demonstrating how the data can be accessed, and inspecting the data to get a quick view on the physical variables available and the data structures used. We will also have a closer look at some **_use cases_** that demonstrate a few useful applications and processing steps. The use cases include some plotting that will learn you about the humidity data and how it can be visualized.

## [Cloud Fractional Cover Climatology](../notebooks/cloud-cover-climatology/cloud-cover-climatology.ipynb)

This notebook provides you with an introduction to EUMETSAT's CM SAF **CLARA-A3** dataset available at the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home)(CDS). The dataset contains data for Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) _Cloud Properties_ as well as _Surface - and Earth Radiaiton Budget_, while this notebook focuses on **Cloud Fractional Cover** as part of the ECV _Cloud Properties_ available here: [Cloud properties global gridded monthly and daily data from 1982 to present derived from satellite observations](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-cloud-properties?tab=overview).

In addition, the tutorial is about the **Surface downwelling longwave/shortwave flux** (as part of the ECV _Surface Radiation Budget_) to demonstrate the relation between clouds and radiation. The data is also available at the CDS: [Surface radiation budget from 1982 to present derived from satellite observations](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-cloud-properties?tab=overview)

The tutorial covers the full process from scratch and starts with a short introdution to the dataset and how to access the data from the Climate Data Store of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). This is followed by a step-by-step guide on how to process and visualize the data. Once you feel comfortable with the python code, you are invited to adjust or extend the code according to your interests! After a short introduction how to use a Jupyter notebook the analysis starts!
