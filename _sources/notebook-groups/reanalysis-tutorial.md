# Reanalysis Tutorial

Reanalysis datasets provide comprehensive, gridded meteorological information spanning multiple decades, offering valuable insights into past weather and climate conditions. This tutorial series delves into the utilization of reanalysis data for various meteorological analyses.

## [Climatology](../notebooks/reanalysis-climatology/reanalysis-climatology.ipynb)

In this tutorial we will access data from the Climate Data Store (CDS) of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), and analyse climatologies and trends in near-surface air temperature. The tutorial comprises the following steps:

1. Search, download and view data
2. Calculate a climate normal
3. Visualise anomalies with respect to the normal
4. Calculate monthly climatology and anomalies
5. View time series and analyse trends

## [Heatwave Analysis](../notebooks/reanalysis-heatwave/reanalysis-heatwave.ipynb)

In September 2020, a record-breaking heatwave occured in large parts of western Europe, ([see a description here](https://climate.copernicus.eu/september-brings-record-breaking-warm-temperatures-and-low-sea-ice)). The city of Lille in northern France for example experienced its hottest day in September 2020 since records began in 1945. In this tutorial we will analyse this event with data from the Climate Data Store (CDS) of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).

The tutorial comprises the following steps:

1. Search, download and view data
2. View daily maximum 2m temperature for September 2020
3. Compare maximum temperatures with climatology
