# Earth Radiation Budget

The Earth's radiation budget is a critical component of the climate system, representing the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing thermal radiation. Understanding this balance is crucial for studying Earth's energy budget and climate dynamics. This tutorial series delves into various aspects of the Earth's radiation budget and related datasets.

## [Outgoing Longwave Radiation](../notebooks/erb-outgoing-longwave-radiation/erb-outgoing-longwave-radiation.ipynb)

This notebook-tutorial provides a practical introduction to the HIRS dataset available on
[C3S Earth's radiation budget from 1979 to present derived from satellite observations](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-earth-radiation-budget?tab=overview).  
<br>
We give a short introduction to the ECV Earth Radiation Budget, Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) and provide three use cases of the dataset: plot the time-averaged global distribution of OLR (Use Case 1), calculate global timeseries of OLR (Use Case 2) and plot the Arctic weighted mean timeseries between 1979 and 2019 (Use Case 3).
We provide step-by-step instructions on data preparation. Use cases come with extensive documentation and each line of code is explained.  
Two figures below are results of Use Case 1 and 2, and the result of a successful run of the code.

## [Analysis of the CLARA Earth Radiation Budget Product](../notebooks/erb-clara-climatology/erb-clara-climatology.ipynb)

This notebook provides you with an introduction on EUMETSAT's CM SAF **CLARA-A3** dataset available at the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) (CDS). The dataset contains data for Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) _Earth Radiation Budget_, as well as _Cloud Properties and Surface Radiaiton Budget_, while this notebook focuses on **Earth Radiation Budget** as part of the ECV _Earth Radiation Budget_ available here: [Earth Radiation Budget from 1982 to present derived from satellite observations](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-earth-radiation-budget?tab=overview).

The notebook covers the full process from scratch and starts with a short introdution to the dataset and how to access the data from the Climate Data Store of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). This is followed by a step-by-step guide on how to process and visualize the data. Once you feel comfortable with the python code, you are invited to adjust or extend the code according to your interests. After a short introduction how to use a Jupyter notebook the analysis starts.<br>
Two figures below are results of Use Case 1 and 2, and the result of a successful run of the code.

## [Analysis of the CERES Earth Radiation Budget Product](../notebooks/erb-ceres-climatology/erb-ceres-climatology.ipynb)

This notebook-tutorial provides an introduction to the use of the
Cloud and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF) Earth's Radiation Budget ([ERB](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-earth-radiation-budget?tab=overview)) data record
for climate studies.

## [Total Solar Irradiance](../notebooks/total-solar-irradiance/total-solar-irradiance.ipynb)

This notebook provides a practical introduction to the
[C3S Earth's radiation budget from 1979 to present derived from satellite observations](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-earth-radiation-budget?tab=overview)
dataset.
We give a short introduction to the ECV Earth Radiation Budget, ECV Product Total Solar Irradiance (TSI), and present two use cases of the dataset: plot the TSI daily values and a 12-month rolling mean, and plot two TSI composite datasets side-by-sides.
