# Tutorials Using Copernicus Emergency Management Service Data

## Introduction to Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS)

The Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) provides timely and reliable information for emergency response operations, including data related to fire weather conditions, flood events, and other natural disasters. This tutorial introduces CEMS, its objectives, and the types of data it offers for emergency management.

## [Visualizing Fire Weather Index (FWI)](../notebooks/visualising-fwi-for-esotc/visualising-fwi-for-esotc.ipynb)

The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a crucial indicator for assessing the risk of forest fires based on weather and fuel moisture conditions. This section of the tutorial focuses on visualizing FWI data obtained from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. It covers methods for interpreting FWI values and creating informative visualizations to assess fire risk.

## [Observing Major Flood Events](../notebooks/glofas-bangladesh-floods/glofas-bangladesh-floods.ipynb)

This tutorial will demonstrate how to investigate a specific flood event using data from the GLObal Flood
Awareness Service (GLOFAS). For this example we look at the major flood event in Bangladesh in June 2022
and assess the excess river discharge in comparison to the long-term (10-year) discharge statistics.

GloFAS is a product and service of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission is the entrusted entity responsible for CEMS GloFAS in terms of management, technical implementation and evolution. ECMWF is the designated contractor to implement the operational functionalities of the CEMS-COMP (Hydrological Forecast Computational Centre).
